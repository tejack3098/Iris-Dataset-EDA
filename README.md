# Exploratory Data Analysis of Iris Dataset 

In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis on the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics. The goal of the project was to understand the relationships between the features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and the target variable (species).

I started by loading the dataset and checking the basic statistics of the data using summary statistics and visualizations. I also checked the distribution of the target variable and performed feature engineering if necessary.

Next, I visualized the relationships between the features using scatter plots, histograms, and box plots. I also checked for correlations between the features using correlation matrices and heatmaps.

Finally, I drew conclusions and insights from the analysis and suggested further steps that could be taken to improve the analysis or build a predictive model based on the data.

Tools and Techniques:

- Python programming language
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- NumPy for numerical calculations

This project helped me gain experience in data analysis, data visualization, and feature engineering, and also provided me with a deeper understanding of the Iris dataset.
